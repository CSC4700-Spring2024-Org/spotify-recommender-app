# spotify-recommender-app
A webapp that allows users to pick their favorite audio elements of a song and search for new recommendations based on this.

**Running Spotify Recommender Locally with VSCode:**

1. First, clone the GitHub repository on your local machine. 
2. Once you have the spotify-recommender-app folder downloaded, open the nested spotify-recommender folder in VSCode (important: this is different than the spotify-recommender-app folder!).
3. Open a Terminal in VSCode by clicking on Terminal > New Terminal in the menu bar. At the bottom of your VSCode window, a command line terminal should be displayed that will execute commands inside of the spotify-recommender folder.
4. npm is a tool that can be used to build and run React projects locally. Install this tool using the following command:
  npm install
5. npm might take a while to install. Once it has finished, you can launch the website with the following command:
  npm start
Again, this might take a second, but this command should open up the React website in your browser.
